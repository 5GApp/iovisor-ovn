# Router

In this example a router module is deployed and three virtual network interfaces
in different network namespaces are connected to it.
In this case the three virtual network interfaces are configured in different
subnets, then a router mechanishm is needed to allow them to exchange data packets.
Connectivity is tested by pinging between the different namespaces

## Preparing the network namespaces

The configuration of the network namespaces and the virtual ethernet interfaces
is very similar to the switch case.
The main difference here is that the three network interfaces are in different
subnets and a default route is configured on each namespace.

Execute the 'setup.sh' script:

```bash
sudo ./setup.sh
```

## Launching hover

Before deploying the router, it is necessary to launch the hover daemon.
Please note to kill other instances of hover previously running.

```bash
export GOPATH=$HOME/go
sudo $GOPATH/bin/hoverd -listen 127.0.0.1:5002
```

## Deploying the router

The `router.yaml` file describes the service topology, in this case it is composed
of a single router module:

```
modules:
  - name: myrouter
    type: router
    config:
      interfaces:
        - name: veth1
          ip: 10.0.1.1
          netmask: 255.255.255.0
          mac: "82:73:8d:f3:62:01"

        - name: veth2
          ip: 10.0.2.1
          netmask: 255.255.255.0
          mac: "82:73:8d:f3:62:02"

        - name: veth3
          ip: 10.0.3.1
          netmask: 255.255.255.0
          mac: "82:73:8d:f3:62:03"

external_interfaces:
  - module: myrouter
    iface: veth1
  - module: myrouter
    iface: veth2
  - module: myrouter
    iface: veth3
```

The file is very similar to the switch example, the only additional part is
the router configuration.
Each interface is configured with the name, ip, netmask and mac parameters, please
note that the name of the interface must match an external interface or another
module (covered in later examples), also the mac is the same assigned to the
interfaces by the `setup.sh` script.

To launch the example please execute:

```bash
export GOPATH=$HOME/go
cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/netgroup-polito/iovisor-ovn/examples/switch
$GOPATH/bin/iovisorovnd -topologyFile router.yaml -hover http://127.0.0.1:5002
```

## Testing connectivity

Now you are able to test the connectivity pinging between the network interfaces
in the different network spaces, for example:

```bash
# ping ns2 from ns1
sudo ip netns exec ns1 ping 10.0.2.100
# ping ns3 from ns1
sudo ip netns exec ns1 ping 10.0.3.100
# ping ns1 from ns3
sudo ip netns exec ns3 ping 10.0.1.100
```

## Debugging

In order to see the debug output generated by the IOModule we suggest to see the result of the print on the trace_pipe.

```bash
sudo su
cd /sys/kernel/debug/tracing/
cat trace_pipe
```
