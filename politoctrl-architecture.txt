Hi:)

Polito Ctrl must have a library package of helper, to perform various requests.
I mean: from cli or ovn-engine I receive a request. This request is routed into
the correspondent helper function

Helper
  Modules:
    PUT
    GET
    DELETE
    ..
    ..

  ..


Client connects to polito ctrl ... or
directly a cli inside politoctrl
